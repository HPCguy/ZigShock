# ZigShock
1D and 3D Zig shock physics examples

The 1D versions are working. Redirect output of execution to a file, then [ > plot "file" ] in gnuplot.

I am currently working through some issues with the 3d version.

==============================================

I will accept pull requests that:

(1) Make better use of Zig language features while keeping the source code approximately the same size or smaller.

** AND **

(2) Have performance that is exactly as fast or faster than the version being replaced, definitely for the ReleaseFast build of the code, and maybe also for the Debug build.
